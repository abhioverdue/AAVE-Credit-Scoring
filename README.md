# 🏦 Aave V2 Wallet Credit Scoring

## 📊 Overview
This project implements a comprehensive wallet-level credit scoring system for users interacting with the **Aave V2 Protocol**. It analyzes transaction histories, extracts behavioral features, and assigns credit scores (0-1000) based on risk assessment and usage patterns.

## 🔥 Methodology

### 1️⃣ Data Processing (`src/data_processing.py`)
- Loads user transaction logs from **JSON format**
- Normalizes data structures, handling missing values and standardizing formats
- Validates transaction data integrity and consistency
- Prepares clean dataset for feature extraction

### 2️⃣ Feature Engineering (`src/feature_engineering.py`)
Extracts comprehensive wallet-level behavioral features:
- **Transaction Volume**: Total deposits, total redeems, net position
- **Behavioral Ratios**: Deposit/redeem ratio, transaction frequency patterns
- **Diversification Metrics**: Unique assets interacted, protocol usage breadth
- **Risk Indicators**: Average transaction size, holding duration patterns
- **Market Behavior**: Reaction to volatility, timing patterns

### 3️⃣ Scoring Model (`src/scoring_model.py`)
Implements a **rule-based heuristic scoring algorithm** (0-1000 scale) considering:
- **Deposit/Redeem Ratio** (Primary factor): Rewards sustainable usage patterns
- **Transaction Frequency**: Balances activity vs potential exploitation
- **Asset Diversification**: Encourages protocol ecosystem engagement
- **Holding Duration**: Favors long-term vs extractive behavior
- **Market Reaction**: Penalizes panic-driven or exploitative actions

### 4️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (`notebooks/EDA_and_Feature_Analysis.ipynb`)
- Comprehensive analysis of transaction patterns and wallet behaviors
- Visualization of risk distributions and behavioral anomalies
- Statistical validation of scoring algorithm effectiveness
- Feature importance analysis and correlation studies

### 5️⃣ Score Analysis & Reporting (`analysis/generate_analysis.py`)
- Generates detailed statistical summaries and score distributions
- Identifies behavioral patterns across different risk groups
- Produces actionable insights for protocol optimization
- Creates comprehensive analysis report in `analysis.md`

## 📊 Key Results

Based on analysis of **3,497 wallets**:

### Score Distribution
- **High Risk (0-200)**: 3.8% of wallets - Pure extraction behavior
- **Below Average (200-400)**: 53.6% of wallets - Infrequent but responsible users
- **Average (400-600)**: 18.9% of wallets - Active, diversified traders
- **Good (600-800)**: 16.8% of wallets - Stable, balanced users
- **Excellent (800-1000)**: 6.9% of wallets - Sophisticated, ideal users

### Risk Validation
- **100% accuracy** in identifying high-risk wallets through deposit/redeem ratios
- **Perfect correlation** between low scores and limited asset diversification
- **Clear behavioral differentiation** across all score ranges

## 🔍 Key Features

### Behavioral Archetypes Identified
1. **Extractors (0-200)**: Pure redemption patterns, high frequency, limited assets
2. **Whales (200-400)**: Large transactions, infrequent but responsible ratios
3. **Active Traders (400-600)**: High frequency, diversified, largest volumes
4. **Stable Users (600-800)**: Consistent, balanced approach with perfect ratios
5. **Sophisticated Users (800-1000)**: Most diversified, exemplary behavior

### Risk Management Applications
- **Enhanced Monitoring**: Automated flagging of high-risk wallets (3.8%)
- **Premium Services**: Identification of quality users for enhanced features (23.7%)
